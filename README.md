## Software tool for track and tracing of Covid-19 patient

<ins>**Project Title:**</ins> Do not touch face CAP and temperature detection system to keep track and prevent the spread of COVID-19

<ins>**Background**</ins>:  The threat of coronavirus disease caused by a novel coronavirus SARS-Cov2 is becoming a life-threatening situation across the globe. In the affected countries and regions, numerous measures have been taken to reduce the person-to-person virus transmission as well as to curb the outbreak. In the case of infectious pandemics like this, prevention is always better than cure. The specific focus of preventive measures is more on the susceptible population of children, healthcare providers, and older people. COVID-19 is unlike any other crisis which is impacting the entire world. Governments across the world are trying to ensure the safety of their citizens and provide support to people affected. Despite fast spread, people across the world are putting up a brave fight and using new-age technologies to maneuver this new situation. These technologies are not only helping us fight the pandemic but may in the future, change how we deal with such situations.
Digital technology that was unavailable just two decades ago is helping millions around the world to keep on working – and it’s also helping health and public authorities to fight the spread of coronavirus. There are several clear ways in which it is helping, though those worried about individual rights and privacy are concerned about some of the trials. Among the solutions proposed by the industry is the use of technology to help health authorities pass warning messages to the public.

<ins>**Objective**</ins>: Our main objective is to implement a system that will help and ensure the authority and every individual to get early live updates and warnings of the possible COVID-19 victim and the places vulnerable to the contracting virus. Our second objective is to prevent people to touch their faces which will keep a check on the people getting infected due to the virus. 


<ins>**Benefits**</ins>  
                  The following are the benefits listed as follows:<br>
	                 1. Ensures safety from suspected Covid-19 victims.<br>
                   2. Stores live data (body temperature and location) on the cloud.<br>
                   3. Prevents the bad practice of touching face as it is against the health recommendation.<br>   
                   4. Capability to give early warning of abnormal body temperature to the nearby person in contact.<br>    
                   5.  It will be a cost-effective and efficient solution.        
 
<ins>**Methodology**</ins>:  The project will be based on the integration of both software and hardware components. It is divided into two parts which are as follows :<br>
1) Do not touch the face system - This system will function with the help of a UV-sensor, a buzzer, and NodeMCU.<br>

Whenever the user will try to touch his/her face, the UV sensor will detect the hand by emitting an ultrasonic wave. On detection of hand, it will send the data to the NodeMCU. The NodeMCU will then warn the user not to touch his/her face by emitting a loud noise with the help of the buzzer.


2) Body Temperature detection system to keep track of possible COVID-19 cases - The system will function with the help of a temperature sensor, NodeMCU, and a mobile application (android/iOS).<br>

The temperature sensor attached in the cap will collect the temperature data of the user's forehead. The data will be then transmitted to the mobile application with the help of NodeMCU (using Wifi technology). The mobile application will store the user's temperature and GPS data on the cloud. Since we know, fever is a major symptom of COVID-19 patients, therefore if any of the users are suffering from fever (determined by the temperature data), the application will warn other users that there might be a possible COVID-19 patient in that particular area (location determined by the GPS sensor of smartphones).<br>
